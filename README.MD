# My notes for TypeScript

## basics.ts
 contains all the basic concepts I've gone over in the past when learning TypeScript.


## generics.ts
 contains the way higher level, generic typescript that I've used to solve type-challenges tasks.
You can find type-challenges [here](https://tsch.js.org/)

## notes folder
has some basic notes and a picture detailing the difference between interface and type

Pretty much just a good summary of what I've learned so far when it comes to non React related TS.
